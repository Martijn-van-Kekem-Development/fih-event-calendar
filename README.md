# Hockey Match Calendar
This script automatically pulls past, active, and upcoming matches from various sources and converts them into neat ics-files for you to subscribe to.

## How does this work?
The script automatically fetches all past, in progress, and upcoming competitions from the configured sources, together with the matches that belong to that competition.
The script will generate an .ics file for every competition separately, and a big .ics file containing all (men's/women's) matches.

Do not import the .ics file manually, rather subscribe to the calendar, so you'll receive updates.
The script will append a checkmark and the final score to matches that have been completed.

## Getting started
