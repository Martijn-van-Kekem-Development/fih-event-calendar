# FIH Event Calendar
This script automatically pulls past, active and upcoming matches from TMS and converts them into neat ICS files to import into your own calendar.

## How-to
[This link](https://martijn-van-kekem-development.github.io/fih-event-calendar/) contains all downloadable ICS-files.
The files get updated automatically every hour.
